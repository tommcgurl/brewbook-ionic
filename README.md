#Brew Book Ionic 
This is the first repo in a series of experiments I've been working on. The plan is to implement a craft beer cataloging app that I've decided to call, __Brew Book__, in the different popular front-end javascript frameworks (React, Angular, Ember, ect.) - [Tom McGurl](@https://twitter.com/tom_mcgurl)

This is my version of the popular [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/), which is the inspiration for this project. I wanted to create a [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) app with some asynchronus data requests that would be close to something you would implement in a real world application.

This verision of the app is implemented with 

- [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/): an SDK that uses [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) for developing hybrid mobile apps. 
- [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) as the a backend with [AngularFire](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/). 
- [ng-Cordova](http://ngcordova.com/) for any hardware interactions such as the camera.
